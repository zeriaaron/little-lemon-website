In this code, I will use React Hook Form + Zod for form validation

According to ChatGPT:
Formik -> for small forms because as it gets bigger, the webpage gets slower because of multiple re-renders
-> as we know if we use useState, values get controlled by React itself and therefore cause re-renders

React Hook Form -> for large forms and for its simplicity
-> reat hook form is like the useRef but with superpowers
-> it is uncontrolled because the DOM controls the value, but
-> there is a function in hook form that gets attached to the input
-> and then store states internally

and we can also use Yup or Zod for schema validation, in this case, I'm going to use Zod

Change of plans:
I will create two versions
1. Using useState, useReducer, and Formik + Yup
2. Using useForm and Zod

1. Install
npm i react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers zod
npm i formik yup
