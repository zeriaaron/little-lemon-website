Goal of managing and sharing state across components

I was taught to use ContextAPI, but I'm going to use Redux for sharing
or providing an API for states to be used by many components

I need to use the state from the Book.jsx and use it in BookingData and ConfirmedBookingPage

1. Install
npm i @reduxjs/toolkit react-reduxjs

2. Create a store folder and a store.jsx or store.js
stateSlice
export { updateState, resetState } = state.actions
export store

3. Use Redux state in components
